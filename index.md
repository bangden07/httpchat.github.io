Hi, I'm Tania. I started the HTTPChat Slack group to have a positive, encouraging environment for programmers, developers, and designers of all levels. I'm a web designer and front end developer, and I also write tutorials and guides.

Hello, I'm Mike. Unlike a lot of the members of HTTPChat, I am fairly new to the tech field. I used to be a science tutor at my local university and currently work in healthcare. My preferred programming language is JavaScript and I am hoping to continue absorbing/leeching all of the valuable knowledge from the wonderful members of HTTPChat :)

## [Jacob Tegtmeier](https://github.com/jtegtmeier)

Hey now! I am a IT guy and Web Developer living in PDX. I have a background in deployment of computer networks, technical support and freelance IT services for small businesses. My academic experience included Object Oriented Design and Web Development using Java and C#.NET. Currently I'm moving to JavaScript full-stack using Node.js and React to solve many of my challenges. I've gained valuable knowledge about many languages and computer science fundamentals along the way, make sure to mention me in slack if you have questions. Maybe I know the answer, maybe we both learn something new!
