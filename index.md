Hello, I'm Mike. Unlike a lot of the members of HTTPChat, I am fairly new to the tech field. I used to teach at my local university and currently work in healthcare. My preferred programming language is JavaScript and I am hoping to continue absorbing/leeching all of the valuable knowledge from the wonderful members of HTTPChat :)
