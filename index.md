The spirit came to me in a warm, wet, autumn night. Rain was dripping down the drain outside my window and white reflected off my dumbfounded face.
`Ş͠TR͟͏̸I͠C͢͠T̵͢ ƯN̴͜I͢D͞͠I̢R̢E͘͜͟C̴T̸̛͜IO͏̶̵N̵̶̡A͏̶L҉ ̢͝D̛AŢ̛A͢F̵L͠Ǫ̛͘W̴̧͘!`, it proclaimed, pointing at the bright computer screen.

"whoagh?" I croaked, still in shock. `STR͟UCT́URAL̕ S͜H́ARING L͞E͏ADS TO SI҉GNI̷FÍC͟A͝NT̨ ̢PE͜RF̢ÒRMAN̸CE͏ ͏G̛A͞I͏N̕S̡` the apparition howled, making wild, sweeping gestures.
"I ... just want to make a simple CRUD app, I don't need --" `N̸O͠OO͠Ooooo̧` the piercing cry came (surely waking the neighbors), and with a theatrical swirl the specter flew into the coffee cup.

A moment passed. Then another. Uncertain of the situation (and worried about my coffee) I carefully peaked over the edge of the cup. `IM͟M̶U̵T͝A͘BLE ṔERSIS͡TENT DAT̸A̡ ͏S̀T͠RÚC̀ --` \<FUMP>. The plastic plate fit nicely on the forfeited coffee cup.

Satisfied I smiled, the silence my reward. Now where as I with the CRUD app?

`no̶͘oo ͝͠d̴͢oņ'̕͟҉t͢ ̵ù̵̴p̸̧̛d̨á̷t̵͞͝ȩ ́i͠n͟ ͏p̧l͠҉a͜͜a͢a̶̶á͢c҉e` the muffled sound came from the wet prison, now oddly glowing green.

"For fuck sake, I'll learn react if you give me back my coffee, whiny translucent bitch."

`i҉ ͟c̀an̴ ͞al̶s̶o͜ reco͟m̵m͜en͟d͞ redux̢ ̢f͘o͡r çǫnt͘ro͡l̡ling̡ t̀h̷e st̡ate̵ ̛in̛ ҉yo̡ưr a͝p̕p,̕ it ̶i̕ś t́h͜e ̷d̨e ͠facto̶ indùstry͝ ͞sta͢n̶da͘rd n̵o͟w̷!`

And so it was.

Hello, I'm Mike. Unlike a lot of the members of HTTPChat, I am fairly new to the tech field. I used to be a science tutor at my local university and currently work in healthcare. My preferred programming language is JavaScript and I am hoping to continue absorbing/leeching all of the valuable knowledge from the wonderful members of HTTPChat :)

## [Jacob Tegtmeier](https://github.com/jtegtmeier)

Hey now! I am a IT guy and Web Developer living in PDX. I have a background in deployment of computer networks, technical support and freelance IT services for small businesses. My academic experience included Object Oriented Design and Web Development using Java and C#.NET. Currently I'm moving to JavaScript full-stack using Node.js and React to solve many of my challenges. I've gained valuable knowledge about many languages and computer science fundamentals along the way, make sure to mention me in slack if you have questions. Maybe I know the answer, maybe we both learn something new!

## [Kelly Robinson](https://github.com/kshimrob)

Hi beautiful humanz! I'm super new to the web dev world so thank you in advance for all the help. I'm currently freelancing and also learning at [Launch School](https://www.launchschool.com). I have a background in neuroscience and East Asian studies. Went from being a middle school math teacher >> managing STEM content at an [Edtech startup](https://www.albert.io/) >> graphic and UI design at the same Edtech startup >> fell in love with front-end dev aaaaaaand decided to leave startup to pursue this magical world ^_^ 

Besides [rolling around in code](https://imgur.com/r/gifs/TI8F7nh), you can find me trying to keep my hair sufficiently purple, letterpressing, screenprinting, sporadically teaching yoga, and writing songs on my ukulele.

I wanted to be Lebron James, but I was better at drawing than dunking a basketball. 3 years ago I found my passion - designing and building websites. Everyday I'm trying to be the King at it.
